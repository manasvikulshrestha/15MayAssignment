    "A1. Comments in Python are identified with a hash symbol, #, and extend to the end of the line. Hash characters in a string are not considered comments, however. There are three ways to write a comment - as a separate line, beside the corresponding statement of code, or as a multi-line comment block.\n",

    "A2. A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name. But the data itself is still contained within the object. \n",
    "For example: n = 300.\n",
    "In Python, we need not declare a variable with some specific data type.\n",
    "Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created when some value is assigned to it. The value assigned to a variable determines the data type of that variable.\n",
